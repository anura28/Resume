\centering\spacedlowsmallcaps{Work Experience}\vspace{1em}

\NewEntry\mbox{Oct '15 -- Present}\qquad{Data \& Systems Engineer}

\Description{\MarginText{Mapbox} \textit{\textbf{Oct 2015 - Oct 2016}}: Built open tools and analytics dashboards using JavaScript, HTML5, NodeJS and d3 for OpenStreetMap. Pre-processed, munged and loaded data for the Mapbox geocoder. Built features into our open-source vector-tile based geocoder, \href{https://github.com/mapbox/carmen}{Carmen}. Worked on implementing data tokenization, data synonyms, data filtering, data ranking based on geographical importance etc.\\\vspace{1.5mm}
\textit{\textbf{April 2016 - Present}}: Worked on over-arching infrastructure, distributed systems and systems engineering at Mapbox. Worked with resources from the AWS market to build in-memory caches; in a second run a year later, I containerised these caches, both projects resulted in huge cost savings - the first one resulted in a 90\% cost savings and the second one in an additional 75\% cost savings. I also architected cache-clearance systems, continuous build systems, migrated several TBs of data from one origin region to another and helped move our stacks from a server-based infrastructure to a dockerised infrastructure. I was a core member in the team that designed, benchmarked, evaluated and released the architecture that helped Mapbox to launch with Snapchat. We scaled our systems to receive 10X the traffic without a marked increase in the cost. In addition, I also onboarded several folks and started  JavaScript hours to teach programming to non-programmers.}

\NewEntry\mbox{Jan '14--Aug '15}\qquad{Lead game engineer}

\Description{\MarginText{Brainwave} \textit{\textbf{Jan '14 - Aug '15}}: Lead game engineer and founding member of the engineering team at Brainwave. As part of a two member engineering team I implemented 30 online science games, and a web interface and database to store user data. The web app took us a year to build and worked on all modern browsers. The web app was also converted into an iOS and Android app using PhoneGap and Cordova. \\\vspace{1.5mm}
Besides code, I implemented version control systems, coding best practises, systems and processes for building, testing and maintaining code and mentored two interns. I also wrote articles for the in-house science magazine, Brainwave.}

\NewEntry\mbox{Jun '12--Aug '12}\qquad{Research Intern}

\Description{\MarginText{BMSIT} \textit{\textbf{Jun '12 - Aug '12}}: Implemented an algorithm to gauge real life sizes of objects in an image, based on the size of a static CD in the image, using openCV and Matlab. The algorithm used image processing techniques like region of interest isolation, segmentation and generating binary images to calculate the CD size in the image, and used it to calculate measurements of other objects in the image, through a user interface.}
